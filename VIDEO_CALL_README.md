- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and keyboard navigation

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend (Signaling Server)
- **Node.js + Express**: HTTP server for health checks and room info
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time WebSocket communication
- **Room Management**: Automatic room creation and cleanup
- **Participant Tracking**: Real-time participant state management

### Frontend (Video Call Client)
- **React + Material-UI**: Modern, responsive UI
- **WebRTC**: Peer-to-peer video/audio streaming
- **Socket.IO Client**: Real-time communication with signaling server
- **Media APIs**: Camera, microphone, and screen sharing

### WebRTC Implementation
- **Peer Connections**: Direct peer-to-peer connections
- **ICE Candidates**: Automatic NAT traversal
- **Stream Management**: Dynamic track replacement
- **Connection Monitoring**: Real-time connection state tracking

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Modern browser with WebRTC support

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

The signaling server will start on port 3002.

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The React app will start on port 5173.

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```env
PORT=3002
NODE_ENV=production
```

### ICE Servers
The WebRTC service uses Google's public STUN servers. For production, consider adding TURN servers:

```javascript
const iceServers = [
  { urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' },
  { urls: 'stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302' },
  // Add TURN servers for production
  {
    urls: 'turn:your-turn-server.com:3478',
    username: 'username',
    credential: 'password'
  }
];
```

## üéØ Usage

### Starting a Meeting
1. Open the application in your browser
2. Enter a room name
3. Allow camera and microphone permissions
4. Share the meeting link with others

### Joining a Meeting
1. Click on a meeting link
2. Allow camera and microphone permissions
3. You'll automatically join the room

### Controls
- **Mute/Unmute**: Toggle microphone
- **Video On/Off**: Toggle camera
- **Screen Share**: Share your screen
- **Chat**: Send text messages
- **Recording**: Record the call
- **Closed Captions**: Enable live transcription

## üß™ Testing

### Test Page
Open `test-video-call.html` in your browser to test the WebRTC functionality:

1. Click "Start Local Video" to test camera/microphone
2. Click "Connect to Server" to test signaling
3. Click "Join Room" to test room functionality
4. Open multiple tabs to test peer connections

### Manual Testing
1. Start the backend server
2. Start the frontend application
3. Open two browser windows/tabs
4. Join the same room in both
5. Verify video/audio works between participants

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Camera/Microphone Not Working
- Check browser permissions
- Ensure HTTPS in production (required for getUserMedia)
- Try refreshing the page

#### Connection Issues
- Check if the signaling server is running
- Verify firewall settings
- Check browser console for errors

#### Video Not Displaying
- Ensure WebRTC is supported in your browser
- Check if camera is being used by another application
- Try using a different browser

### Debug Information
The application provides detailed logging:
- Browser console for WebRTC events
- Server console for signaling events
- UI status indicators for connection state

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Backend Deployment
1. Set up a Node.js server (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.)
2. Configure environment variables
3. Set up SSL certificates
4. Use PM2 or similar for process management

### Frontend Deployment
1. Build the React app: `npm run build`
2. Deploy to a static hosting service
3. Configure CORS settings
4. Set up CDN for better performance

### Security Considerations
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement authentication
- Add rate limiting
- Use TURN servers for NAT traversal
- Implement room access controls

## üìä Performance

### Optimizations
- **Video Quality**: Adaptive bitrate based on connection
- **Audio Processing**: Echo cancellation and noise suppression
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection and fallback
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of media streams

### Monitoring
- Connection quality indicators
- Participant count tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Performance metrics
